 so after connecting we get that pika messages .
 the first thing will popup in our minds as pokemon but there is Pikalang wich is a joke esotric programming language and its identical to brainfuck , except that the instructions are changed into the sounds made by Pikachu From Pok√©mon 
 as you can see the table below each word have its instructions .
 we can use an interpreter to see what this mean 
 i found this one that is written in python and it works find thanks to

 so that means " HELLO WORLD "
 we go back to nc and write HELLO WORLD , we get another one that we saw in the  table 
 which is BrainF*ck
 and for that we can use this online interpreter https://copy.sh/brainfuck/
 after running we get "This is f**king my brain" so lets go and write that .
 oh we get another that is called Malbolge its another esoteric language and i checked every estoric language that have that weird ecriture to find it 
 and i used this online interpreter to execute and get the flag 
 http://malbolge.doleczek.pl/
 flag : b00t2root{e50t3ric_langu4g35_ar3_1n5an3}
#estoric languages are really amazing
